The French destroyer Jaguar was a Chacal-class destroyer (contre-torpilleur) built for the French Navy during the 1920s. She spent most of her pre-World War II career as a flagship for various destroyer units. The ship was assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic after the start of the World War II in September 1939 until she was badly damaged during a collision in January 1940. Five months later, after her repairs were completed, she was committed to the English Channel after the Battle of France began in May 1940. Jaguar was torpedoed by German E-boats on 23 May and had to beach herself; her wreck was written off as unrepairable.
