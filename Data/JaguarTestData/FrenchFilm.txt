Jaguar is a 1967 French ethnographic film directed by Jean Rouch. Set in the 1950s, it follows three men from Niger, Damour√©, Lam, and Illo, who travel to the Gold Coast (now Ghana) for work. Much of the dialogue and narration in the film is provided by the three men themselves as they comment on their past experiences on their journey.
