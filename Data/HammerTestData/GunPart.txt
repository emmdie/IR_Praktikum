The hammer is a part of a firearm that is used to strike the percussion cap/primer, or a separate firing pin,[1] to ignite the propellant and fire the projectile. It is so called because it resembles a hammer in both form and function. The hammer itself is a metal piece that forcefully rotates about a pivot point.[2]
