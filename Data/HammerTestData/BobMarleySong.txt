"Hammer" is a song by Bob Marley. It was first recorded early in Marley's career (probably 1968) but never appeared on the Bob Marley & The Wailers studio albums in the seventies. JAD Records ultimately released remastered versions of the early studio sessions of Bob Marley & Wailers; "Hammer" is included on Fy-ah, Fy-ah and a Sly and Robbie remix of the song is included on Man To Man.[1] A version of the song also appears on the box-set Songs of Freedom.
